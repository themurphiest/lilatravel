    desc: "Hiking, biking, paddling, climbing. Your body in motion through extraordinary terrain.",
    details: ["Canyon trail running at golden hour", "Mountain biking through aspen groves", "Sea kayaking along wild coastlines", "Summit hikes timed to sunrise"],
    longDesc: "Movement is the oldest form of prayer. When your body engages with extraordinary terrain — scrambling up sandstone, pedaling through aspens, paddling along wild coasts — something shifts. The internal noise quiets. You stop thinking about moving and simply move. This is the threshold where fitness becomes meditation, where the trail becomes the teacher.",

    desc: "Yoga, meditation, breathwork, mindfulness. The inner journey that makes the outer one matter.",
    details: ["Cliffside vinyasa at dawn", "Forest bathing in old-growth groves", "Guided pranayama sessions", "Silent walking meditation"],
    longDesc: "The breath is always here, always now. In the yogic tradition, pranayama — the expansion of life force through breath — is the bridge between body and mind. We weave these practices into every trip: sunrise vinyasa on cliff edges, forest bathing among ancient trees, guided breathwork that opens something you didn't know was closed. The outer journey becomes the catalyst for the inner one.",

    desc: "Stargazing, hot springs, cold plunges, sunrise rituals, ancient ceremonies. Senses wide open.",
    details: ["Dark sky stargazing with telescopes", "Natural hot spring soaks at dusk", "Cold plunge & breathwork rituals", "Equinox & solstice ceremonies"],
    longDesc: "To awaken is to remember what you already know — that you are part of something vast. Stargazing in dark sky preserves, soaking in natural hot springs as the last light fades, plunging into cold water that shocks you into absolute presence. These aren't activities. They're invitations to experience the raw, unfiltered wonder of being alive. We time many of our trips to natural crescendos: solstices, equinoxes, meteor showers, full moons.",

    word: "Connect", icon: "△",
    color: C.sunSalmon,
    desc: "Local food, art, culture, music, history, service. Rooting into the soul of a place.",
    details: ["Farm-to-table dining experiences", "Indigenous cultural exchanges", "Live music under the stars", "Community service & give-back days"],
    longDesc: "A place is more than its landscape. It's the people who tend it, the food that grows from it, the stories it holds. Connection means eating at the farmer's table, learning from indigenous wisdom keepers, listening to live music under open sky, and giving back to the communities that welcome you. This is how a destination becomes a relationship — not something you visit, but something you belong to, even briefly.",
